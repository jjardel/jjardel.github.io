I grew up in southern New Jersey, but I've been calling Austin, TX home since I first came here to start graduate school
in 2008.  I studied black holes and dark matter for my thesis, and received my PhD in astrophysics in 2014.  Shortly after
I started a career as a data scientist working for a local startup named [Square Root](http://square-root.com/).  I like hiking, playing softball and volleyball, and I really enjoy good food and craft cocktails. 
I recently picked up [photography as a hobby](https://www.flickr.com/photos/131897965@N02/albums).  

The original title of this blog was "The Wannabe Data Scientist", since I started it while I was looking for my first
job.  Having been gainfully employed now for 3 years, that title had a bit of a different connotation so it had to go.   Once I stopped being a "wannabe" data scientist I took a break from posting, but I couldn't stay away for too long.  I plan on
(semi) regularly updating the site with new posts, while at the same time trying not to laugh too much at my old non-PEP-8 code.
