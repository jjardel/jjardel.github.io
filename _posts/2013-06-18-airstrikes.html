title: Understanding Aircraft Bird Strikes--(Messing Around with Tableau)
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

Ok I'll admit it, I'm a bit of a nervous flyer. &nbsp;I'm the guy on the plane who looks around at all the flight attendants after every little bump or noise to make sure nothing's wrong. &nbsp;So when a United Airlines 737 was taken down by a flock of geese, that was the last thing I needed to hear about. &nbsp;I had no idea something as small as a bird could have such an impact on a 30 ton aircraft.<br />
<br />
And then there was that episode of Mythbusters where they shot chickens out of a cannon into an old aircraft frame to see the damage.<br />
<br />

Even though it turns out they were shooting frozen chickens (they forgot to thaw them), the results were still scary. <br />

<br />
So how frequent are bird strikes? &nbsp;And when do they occur? &nbsp;I was given a dataset containing information about all the recorded bird strikes over the past 12 years. &nbsp;The first thing I noticed was that the file was almost 100,00 lines long. &nbsp;Crap.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, out of these 100,000 strikes there were only 107 injuries and 5 fatalities. &nbsp;Humans seemed to fare much better than the birds. &nbsp;In order to get the most out of this rich dataset, I used Tableau--a data visualization product that can make some fancy interactive visualizations.<br />

<tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I had no idea that bird can fly as high as 25,000 feet! &nbsp;It makes sense that some of the most damaging (costliest) strikes occurred when the plane was traveling fast at a higher altitude.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Texas and California have had the most strikes, but this is a bit misleading. &nbsp;They are also the most populous states, and have some of the nation's largest airports. &nbsp;There are many more flights originating in these two states compared to other smaller states. &nbsp;That means there are many more chances for a strike.</td></tr>
